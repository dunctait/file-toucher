# file-toucher

File toucher is an application to update the various timestamps on files in a Windows environment, similarly to the 'touch' function in Linux.

The original purpose of the application was/is to convince the Google Music application to upload music, though it can't be guaranteed the functions of this program will still apply to Google Musics inner workings.
